# Snake Game

Overview: In this application, users can play a snake game. The objective of the game is to allow the snake to eat the apples without allowing the snake to
collide with its own body. 

How it works: With each apple that the snake eats, the score will increase by 1 point. Along with the score increment, the snake body will also increase 
its size by 1 square box. The head of the snake is blue and the body is black. If the user allows the snake to collide with its own body, the program
will end displaying a message in the console. The message will inform the users that the snake collided with its own body and to restart the game.

Conditions: If the snake goes too far to the right, left, up, or down of the screen it will automatically come back through the opposite end of the frame.
With each increment to the snake, a new black box appears after the blue head is displayed on the screen. The game ends once the user collides with the snake body.

Note: This game was designed and developed using Eclipse (IDE - integrated development environment) and made in Java.
